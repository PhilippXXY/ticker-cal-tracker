# Store your API keys for local development in a .env file, as it is under .gitignore.
# Later when building the container Github Actions we will probably change the code to using the environmental variables.

# API Keys for external services
# API_KEY_ALPHA_VANTAGE=your_alpha_vantage_key_here
# API_KEY_FINNHUB=your_finnhub_key_here

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT set DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, etc. in .env for local development
# Database integration tests will ONLY run against localhost (127.0.0.1)
# Setting DB_HOST to a production IP will cause tests to fail with a safety check error
